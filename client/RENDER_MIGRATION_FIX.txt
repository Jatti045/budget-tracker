# Quick Fix for Render Database Migration

## The Issue
Your Render build command includes 'npx prisma migrate deploy' but it seems to have failed silently or the migrations table is out of sync.

## Quick Solution: Force Redeploy on Render

1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com
2. Select your 'budgettracker-api' service  
3. Click 'Manual Deploy' > 'Clear build cache & deploy'
4. Watch the build logs to ensure migrations run successfully

## Check Build Logs For:
`
 Prisma Migrate applied 7 migrations
`

## If Migrations Still Fail:

Try using db push instead (temporary):

1. In Render Dashboard > Settings > Build Command:
   Change to: `npm ci && npm run build && npx prisma db push --force-reset`
   
2. Deploy again

3. After successful deploy, change back to:
   `npm ci && npm run build && npx prisma migrate deploy`
